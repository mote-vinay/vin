The error message indicates that you cannot remove the `getting-started` image because there is a running or stopped container that is using it. To resolve this, you have a couple of options:

1. **Stop and Remove the Container**:
   First, find the container using the image. You can list all containers (including stopped ones) with:

  
   docker ps -a
   

   Look for the container with ID `3014088d29e5` and note its name or ID. Then stop and remove the container:

   
   docker stop 3014088d29e5
   docker rm 3014088d29e5
   

   After removing the container, you should be able to remove the image:

   
   docker rmi getting-started
   

2. **Force Removal of the Image**:
   If you're sure you want to remove the image and its associated container, you can use the `-f` option to force the removal:

   
   docker rmi -f getting-started
   

   This will remove the image even if there are containers that are using it.






 1. **Why `127.0.0.1:3000:3000`?
- **`127.0.0.1`**: This is the loopback address, also known as localhost. It means that the application will only be accessible from your local machine.
- **`:3000:3000`**: This maps port 3000 on your local machine to port 3000 in the container. 
  - The first `3000` is the port on your host (your machine).
  - The second `3000` is the port on the container where your application is listening.

This setup allows you to access your application by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:3000` in your web browser.

 2. **What does `-dp` mean?
-d`**: This flag runs the container in detached mode, meaning it runs in the background and does not block your terminal.
-p`**: This flag maps the ports (as explained above). You can specify which host port maps to which container port.

So, the command `docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 getting-started` means:
- Run the `getting-started` image as a container in the background.
- Map port 3000 on your local machine to port 3000 in the container.
